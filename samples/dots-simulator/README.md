# Dots simulator

This folder contains the sample source for our Dots-simulator. Dots-simulator is my attempt to stimulate students
with some exercises on Python to create a simulator which simulate a popular mobile game, see [Dots game](http://weplaydots.com/).
As students work through the assignment, students get to learn important concepts in programming from abstraction down
to implementation of the project.

* See [test.py](test.py) for gradual breakdown of independent challenges while we
  build the simulator. Students may want to adapt similar outlines to try out their implementation as they work on their implementation.
  
* See [game.py](game.py) for the sample solution.
