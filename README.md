# MyPythonEssentialsClass-2015

The following are the materials I used for my recent Python courses delivered to mainly industrial engineers from variety of backgrounds (software and hardware) interested to develop Python scripts to automate their workflows. The course was designed to put more emphasis on practical use of programming concepts in Python for beginners to intermediate. Topics covered ranging from fundamentals, OO, regular expression, concurrent programming. Finally students are able to stimulate their understanding of the concepts further by working on a game project.
